            <p class="text-light-blue">iADAATPA Programs and Services</p>
            <p>If you apply to become a iADAATPA client, we will use the personally identifying information you provide
                (e.g., your name, address, email address, company information and payment information) to follow up with
                you about your application and facilitate the enrolment process.
            </p>

                While providing you with customer support we
                may also gather additional information from you. From time to time we will also offer you the
                opportunity to receive information about products or services offered by our third-party partners. We
                will not share your personally identifying information with these third parties for their marketing
                purposes, unless we have your permission to do so. </p>
            <p>We use information submitted through our Web site or collected through email or hard copy surveys to
                analyze the characteristics of our customers and improve our services. We will occasionally provide
                anonymized aggregated statistics about our clients in reports made available to them, to third parties,
                or to the general public. These reports will not identify individual iADAATPA clients. </p>

                    and additional company information. We use this information to
                    contact you about your request, or to follow up with you about the
                    programs and services in which you have expressed an interest.</p>
